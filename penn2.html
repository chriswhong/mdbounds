<p>A month earlier, in March of 1683, King Charles II officially granted the lands
  of the three lower counties to the Duke of York. At this point, the Duke could
  have then officially transfered the land to Penn, but Penn's advisors sought
  to revise the grant the Duke had received, to give him more land (which would
  in turn be transfered to Penn). Lord Baltimore protested the revision, and the
  King held all action on this grant until both Penn and Lord Baltimore could
  come to England to argue their cases.
<p>In February of 1685, King Charles II died, and the Duke of York became King
  James II. The question of the three lower counties was refered to the Board
  of Trade and Foreign Plantations, who returned their decision in November of
  1685.
<p>'The Lords of the Committee for Trade and Plantations having pursuant to His
  late Majesty's Order in Councill of the 31 of May 1683 examined the Matters
  in Difference between the Lord Baltemore and William Penn Esqre in behalf of
  his present Majesty concerning a Tract of Land in America commonly called Delaware,
  their Lordships find that the Land intended to be granted by the Lord Baltemore's
  Patent was only Land uncultivated and inhabited by savages, and that this Tract
  of Land now in dispute was inhabited and planted by Christians at and before
  the Date of the Lord Baltemore's Patent as it hath been ever since to this time
  and continued as a distinct colony from that of Maryland, so that their Lordships
  humbly offer their opinion that for avoyding further differences the Tract of
  Land lying between the River and Bay of Delaware and the Eastern Sea on the
  one side and Chesapeak Bay on the other, be divided into two equall parts by
  a line from the latitude of Cape hinlopen to the 40th degree of Northern latitude
  and that one half thereof lying towards the Bay of Delaware & the Eastern sea
  be adjudged to belong to his Majesty & that the other half remain to the Lord
  Baltemore as comprized within his Charter.' (AOM 5:396)
<p>The Dutch settlement of Swanendael in 1631 is what influenced this decision.
  King James ordered the division to be made on November 7, 1685. '...His Majesty
  well approving of the said Report It was there upon ordered by His Majesty in
  Councill that the said Land be forthwith divided accordingly...'
<p>The 'decision of 1685', as this event would be called, included reference to
  40 degrees being the southern boundary of Pennsylvania. Had the orders been
  carried out, the lines drawn, and markers placed, the conflict might have been
  over. Despite officially losing claim to the three lower counties, Maryland
  would have its northern boundary set at 40 degrees north latitude.
<p>The lines were never drawn, and in 1688, King James II was succeeded by William
  and Mary, who declared Maryland and Pennsylvania to be royal provinces in 1690
  and 1691 respectively. Nothing significant would occur regarding the boudary
  dispute until 40 years later. Charles third Lord Baltimore died in 1715. Benedict
  Leonard Calvert, fourth Lord Baltimore would survive him by only a few months,
  and rule of Maryland was returned to Charles, fifth Lord Baltimore when he was
  only an infant.
<p>Rule of Pennsylvania was returned to William Penn in 1694, but he made no progress
  in settling the borders due to financial trouble. He died in 1718, and his four
  sons, John, Thomas, Richard and Dennis inherited the colony.
<p>It was not until 1731 that Charles, Fifth Lord Baltimore asked King George
  II to order the proprietors of Pennsylvania to meet and settle the boundaries.
  Lord Baltimore and the Penns were present in England for the conferences, which
  were overseen by the Comittiee for Trade and Plantations. They eventually came
  to an agreement in 1732, which was very similar to conditions established in
  1685. However, for unknown reasons, they agreed that the northern boundary of
  Maryland should be located 15 miles to the south of Philadelphia. This is most
  likely because Philadelphia, along with other settlements in the disputed area,
  had been established for almost 50 years as being in Pennsylvania, although
  they were below the 40 degree line. The boundary of the lower counties was to
  be a line drawn due west from 'Cape Henlopen' across the peninsula, from the
  center of which another line should be drawn tangent to a circle twelve miles
  from New Castle. At the point where this line touched the circle, another line
  would continue due north until it reached the northern border.
<p>Again, nothing immidiately came of this agreement. Both colonies sent comissioners
  to discuss surveying of the circle around New Castle, who met 6 times over the
  next few months and could not come up with any kind of result. Commissioners
  for both sides questioned where the center of the circle should be located,
  and the Marylanders argued that the circle was originally meant to be 12 miles
  in circumference (a much smaller circle, giving more land to Maryland). Ultimately,
  they all signed a ntice saying that they could not agree on instructions to
  give to the surveyors.
<p>In 1735, a chancery suit began in English Courts that would not be resolved
  for another 15 years. The purpose of this suit was to make sure the agreement
  of 1732 was carried out. In addition to the comissioners being unable to come
  to agreement on the New Castle circle, Lord Baltimore would not agree to lay
  out the southern boundary because of a geographic inaccuracy. During the discussions
  that lead to the agreement of 1732, it was decided that it would be difficult
  to set the boundaries clearly without a map. Lord Baltimore's map was selected,
  but after the lines were drawn on the map, it was discovered that 'Cape Henlopen'
  was in the wrong place. The accepted location of Cape Henlopen was at the town
  of Lewes, at the opening of the Delaware Bay. Lord Baltimore's inaccurate map
  placed it 15 miles to the south, at a 'false cape' located at present day Fenwick
  Island. (<a href="figures.html">see figure 6</a>) The Penns tried to use this
  to their advantage, and claimed the southern boundary of Delaware should be
  located, as the map indicated, at the false cape. (<a href="figures.html">see
  figure 8</a>) The chancery suit would continue unresolved until 1750.
<p>In 1738, fed up with more border incidents, the Governor and both houses of
  Maryland petitioned King George II again, asking for him to make some kind of
  ruling. The King ruled that temporary lines should be drawn immediately and
  without question. To the east of the Susquehanna River, the line was to be drawn
  at 15.25 miles south of Phildelphia, and to the west at 14.47 miles south of
  Philadelphia. These lines were promptly drawn, and were accepted until 1763.
<p>In 1750, Lord Hardwicke presented a verdict in the 'Great Chancery Suit' and
  stated that the agreement of 1732 had to be carried out. He answered all of
  the looming questions that both sides had been confused about. The circle around
  New Castle was to be 12 miles in radius, and its center was to be the center
  of the town. (it was agreed on that the center would be the spire of the dome
  of the courthouse) The southern boundary of the three lower counties was to
  be located as it was on the map presented in 1732, at the false cape.
<p>It seemed finally that all of the questions had been answered, and that the
  lines would be surveyed to put an end to the 70 year old argument. On November
  14th, 1750 commissioners met at New Castle to begin surveying the circle. They
  agreed that the belfry of the courthouse would be the circle, but when it came
  to how the radii would be measured, the parties reached another disagreement.
  The radius had to be measured with chains. The Marylanders wanted to measure
  up hill and down valleys, while the Pennsylvanians wanted to use strictly horizontal
  measurements, which would be more accurate. They also argued over how many radii
  should be chained out, and in which directions, in order to make a visible,
  accurate boundary. These concerns were again brought before a court in England.
<p>The surveyors selected to mark the south border of the three lower counties
  were John Watson and William Parsons for Maryland and John emory and Thomas
  Jones for Pennsylvania. They were more successful than the commissioners at
  the New Castle circle, but their task was not completed without some controversy.
  They began in April of 1750, and by June 12 had reached Slaughter creek, 66
  miles west of their starting point on the Atlantic coast. The length of this
  line, which received the name 'The Transpenisular Line', would determine where
  the midpoint was, and the midpoint would determine where the western border
  of the three lower counties would begin. The surveyors continued across the
  creek and reached the Chesapeake Bay at 69 miles. Their work was approved by
  the commissioners, but problems arose over whether or not Slaughter creek qualified
  as a part of the bay. If so, the transpeninsular line would have been 66 miles,
  long, and the southern border of the three lower counties would be 33 miles
  long instead of 34.5, which would result in more land for Maryland.
<p>Stone monuments were placed at 5 mile intervals along the line from the atlantic
  coast to the 25 mile point. These stones were engraved with the coat of arms
  of Lord Baltimore on the Maryland side, and with the coat of arms of the Penns
  on the Pennsylvania side. (<a href="figures.html">see figure 7</a>) The Penn
  arms were modified to indicate the distinction of the three lower counties.
  Some of these stones still stand today.
<p>In July of 1760, another decision was reached regarding the unsolved disputes
  of the surveys of 1750. The Lord High Chancellor ruled that the chaining of
  the New Castle circle should be done horizontally, and that the transpeninsular
  line should extend the full distance to the open water of the Cheseapeake Bay.
  Its location at the false cape was also confirmed. The northern boundary of
  Maryland was set at 15 miles south of the most southern point of Philadelphia,
  as had been agreed on in 1685. Commissioners from both sides set the middle
  point of the transpeninsular line, and several locations on the New Castle circle.
  The line that would start at the middle point and run tangent to the New Castle
  circle would prove to be a much more difficult surveying feat. After two failed
  attempts to run the line tangent to the circle, the surveyors were informed
  that Maryland and Pennsylvania had hired two English Scientists to complete
  the surveys.
<p>Charles Mason, and Jeremiah Dixon were employed to 'mark, run out, setlle,
  fix and determine all such parts of the Circle, Marks, lines and boundaries
  as are mentioned in the several articles of agreement or comissions and are
  not yet completed.' They arrived in Philadelphia on November 15, 1763. Mason
  and Dixon would spend the next 5 years accompishing this task. They ran the
  northern boundary line as far west as they could until indians would not allow
  them to proceed. This was actually 30 miles farther than the current western
  boundary of Maryland, but that boundary had not been laid out yet, and would
  be the source of its own disputes.
<p>After 82 years of disagreement both in and out of courts, there would be no
  further argument over the northern boundary of Maryland, or of the boundary
  between Maryland and the three lower counties. The boundaries were marked with
  stone monuments, bearing the arms of the Penns and Calverts on their respective
  sides. The lines laid out by Mason and Dixon serve as the present day boundaries
  between Maryland, Delaware and Pennsylvania, along with the eastern half of
  the transpeninsular line.
