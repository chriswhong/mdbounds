<p>The Atlantic coast, and the western shore of the Delaware Bay were host to
  non-Maryland colonization as early as 1631. The Dutch had claimed lands in the
  Hudson and Delaware river valleys. New Amsterdam was established in 1626 at
  the mouth of the Hudson River, and several other trading posts were located
  along the Delaware River and in surrounding areas.</p>
<p> In 1631 Samuel Godyn, under the Dutch West India Company started a settlement
  with 32 people at the site of present day Lewes, Delaware. (<a href="figures.html">see
  figure 3</a>) Swanendael, as they named it, would not last long, and was destroyed
  by indians less than a year after it was founded. The small settlement was a
  failure, but its short existence would become a technicality which, later, would
  cost Maryland a large amount of territory.</p>
<p> In March of 1638, New Sweden was established at the site of present day Wilmington.
  The 25 settlers erected Fort Christina, and their colony grew with the support
  of the Swedish government. It is said that the Swedish colonists had more initial
  success than their English counterparts because they were better prepared for
  the extreme temperatures of the region. 'Travelers noted the greater warmth
  and comfort of the Swedish log houses, which became the prototype of the American
  Frontiersman's abode.'</p>
<p> The Dutch considered Fort Christina to be in the territory of New Netherland.
  Peter Stuyvesant, the governor of New Netherland was forbidden to attack New
  Sweden, because the Dutch government did not want to upset relations with Sweden.
  He instead built Fort Casimir at present day New Castle in 1651. (<a href="figures.html">see
  figure 3</a>) This Fort was not an immediate threat to New Sweden, but it was
  situated on land that the Swedih had purchased from indians and claimed. In
  1654 Johan Rising, the new governor of New Sweden attacked and conquored Fort
  Casimir. The fort was not well garrisoned, and the Dutch did not lose much in
  this attack, but they now had an excuse to retaliate against New Sweden.</p>
<p> In September of 1655, Stuyvesant did just that, with a small fleet and hundreds
  of men sent from New Masterdam. He quickly retook Fort Casimir and moved on
  to surround and conquor Fort Christina. Governor Rising surrendered, and turned
  over all of the territory claimed by New Sweden to the Dutch. </p>
<p>Under the control of the Dutch, the town of New Amstel grew up around Fort
  Casimir, the town of Altena grew where Fort Christina had been, and a new settlement
  was established where Swanendael had failed. Also at this time in the late 1650s,
  these Dutch towns began trading with Maryland, from whom they bought tobacco.</p>
<p> Lord Baltimore sent officials to New Amstel in 1659 to inform the Dutch colonists
  that they were in Maryland territory, but they paid no honor to his claim. Maryland
  most likely did not further confront the Dutch for fear of starting international
  incidents, and also because of the secondary market for tobacco sales that the
  Dutch presented. </p>
<p>The Duke of York, brother of King Charles II, was granted all of the land between
  the Delaware and Connectucuit rivers in 1664. He sent a force to remove Dutch
  rule from his territory, which quickly conquored New Amsterdam, and changed
  its name to New York. His troops then proceeded to the Delaware River where
  they conquored Altena and New Amstel, which they renamed New Castle. The leaders
  of the Duke's forces knew that the settlements on the west bank of the Delaware
  were not in his land grant, but they saw it as their duty to remove the Dutch.
  They also knew the land belonged to Maryland, but as the flourishing Dutch-Maryland
  tobacco trade had established, the land was valuable. </p>
