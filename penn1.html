<p>William Penn received his charter for Pennsylvania in 1681. It was granted
  by King Charles II to repay a debt owed by the king to Penn's late father, Admiral
  Sir William Penn. It was the creation of Pennsylvania that would spawn Maryland's
  longest territorial dispute, which would take almost a century to finally resolve.
  Pennsylvania's charter explained the boundaries in great detail. </p>
<p>'... bounded on the East by Delaware River, from twelve miles distance Northwards
  of New Castle Towne unto the three and fortieth degree of Northerne Latitude...The
  said Lands to extend westwards five degrees in longitude, to bee computed from
  the said Easterne Bounds; and the said Iands to bee bounded on the North by
  the beginning of the three and fortieth degree of Northern Latitude, and on
  the South by a Circle drawne at twelve miles distance from New Castle Northward
  and Westward unto the beginning of the fortieth degree of Northern Latitude,
  and then by a streight Line Westward to the Limitt of Longitude above-mentioned.'(Pennsylvania
  charter)</p>
<p> In essence, all of the land north of 40 degrees, south of 43 degrees, and
  west of the Delaware river, extending westward for 5 degrees. It is apparent
  that the King (or the map-weilding geographers that advised him) believed the
  town of New Castle to be within this tract. New Castle belonged to the Duke
  of York, which he had rightfully conquested from the Dutch. Since the King wanted
  to make sure none of his brother's land was given to Penn, the clause about
  '...a Circle drawne at twelve miles distance from New Castle...' would make
  sure Pennsylvania did not overlap with the Duke of York's lands. The maps that
  were referenced when the charter was drafted had to be inaccurate, because New
  Castle was actually 25 miles south of the 40 degree line. It was impossible
  for a 12 mile circle around New Castle to ever touch the 40th parallel. (<a href="figures.html">see
  figure 4</a>) The Pennsylvania charter could have excluded any reference to
  New Castle, and the Duke of York's land would not have been under any kind of
  threat from Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>Penn sent William Markham, his deputy governor, to Lord Baltimore's home on
  the Patuxent in August of 1681 to discuss the boundaries. Markham arrived with
  two letters, one from William penn and another form the King explaining his
  wish for both colonies to establish their borders. </p>
<p>'...make a true division and separation of the said provinces of Maryland and
  Pennsylvania, according to the bounds and degrees of our said Letters Patent
  and fixing certain Land Marks where they shall appear to border upon each other
  for the preventing and avoiding all doubts and controversies that may otherwise
  happen concerning the same.' (Bayliff, p5) </p>
<p>Markham became ill during this conference, and nothing was settled. The two
  agreed to meet again the following October, but Markham later sent notice that
  he needed to postpone again. After a new date was decided, Markham sent notice
  that he had bceom ill, and could not attend.</p>
<p> On September 16, 1681, Penn, misinformed about his southern boundary, sent
  letters to plantations in Baltimore and Cecil counties, notifying the owners
  that they were seated in Pennsylvania, and should not pay taxes to Lord Baltimore.
  Many settlers in these counties did refuse to pay, and Lord Baltimore had to
  order his military officers to aid the local sherrifs in enforcing the collection
  of the taxes. '...with great difficulty it was that some of the inhabitants
  were made to comply with the then Publick leavy...'</p>
<p> The crisis in the northern counties made Lord Baltimore more eager to reach
  a settlement, indeed 'the quiet and peace of Maryland very much required it.'
  The next meeting was scheduled for June at the plantation of Augustine Herrman,
  near New Castle. Lord Baltimore could not attend, but he sent two surveyors
  to represent him. Markham never showed up, so the surveyors took obervations
  of the latitude of the site, and sent reports back to Lord Baltimore.</p>
<p> 'We have taken three severall observations and in all of them have not differed
  two minutes and we find Mr Augustin Herman's house to lye in the latitude of
  39(degrees) and 45(minutes)...wee have used our endeavours in letting all here
  know of your Ldp's desire to have the bounds determined and all seem much satisfied
  with your Lordship's proceedings much blaming Mr Markham that after so many
  flourishes he should be thus backward...' (AOM 5:371)</p>
<p> Lord Baltimore finally met with Markham (who was several days late) at Upland,
  a site just north of New Castle in September. Lord Baltimore brought surveyors,
  as did Markham, and both parties agreed that the latitude of the site was at
  39 degrees, 47 minutes, and 5 seconds. Markham agreed to meet him in New Castle
  the next day, where they would both travel up the river to find the 40 degree
  line. Markham never showed up, and Lord Baltimore later received a letter from
  him indicating why no settlement could be reached. </p>
<p>'My Lord, this is my reason, that as I received all that part of the river
  Delaware beginning twelve miles above New Castle Towne and soe upwards ... I
  most humbly conceive that I am not to be accomptable to any other person then
  His Majesty...But if your Lordshipp be willing to lay out the bounds betwixt
  this Province and your Lordshipps Laying towards Chesapeake Bay and the rivers
  on that side I am ready & willing to wayte upon your Lordshipp for that end
  and purpose.' (AOM 5:397) </p>
<p>Markham was stating that he could not agree with the 40 degree line as a boundary
  because it was more than 12 miles from New Castle, which would violate the Pennsylvania
  charter, whch was granted by the King, who's orders he would not supercede.
  (<a href="figures.html">see figure 4</a>) He proposes that he would be willing
  to comply with a boundary set further south, but under the same logic as his
  first argument, since such a boundary would not be located at the 40 degree
  line, it would also be a violation of the King's charter. An impasse had been
  reached, and at this point further conferences were held off until William Penn
  himself could attend them in person. </p>
<p>A month before Lord Balitmore's meeting with Markham at Upland, William Penn
  had been in England attempting to secure more land for himself. He realized
  that his colony had no access to the sea, and so he asked the Duke of York to
  give him posession of the the land on the west bank of the Delaware. While the
  Duke had been governing the counties as part of New York, he did not actually
  have any legal claim to them. He did give them to Penn in August of 1682, and
  provided both a deed and a 10,000 year lease for the land. It is assumed that
  the reason for this was the Duke's unoffical claim to the land. It was thought
  that the lease would be effective until the Duke's claims to the land could
  be legally set, at which point he would officially transfer the land to William
  Penn.</p>
<p> Penn arrived at New Castle in October of 1682, and formally took posession
  of the town and its surrounding lands. He sent William Markham to take posession
  of the rest of the land. From this point onward the land was referred to as
  the 'three lower counties' of Pennsylvania. The addition of the lower counties
  to Penn's claims would serve to further complicate the disputes between Maryland
  and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p> Another meeting was scheduled, and Penn went to Annapolis to meet with Lord
  Baltimore on December 13, 1862. At this meeting, Penn proposed an unscientific
  and impractical means of locating the 40 degree line.</p>
<p> 'The Capes for several years have bin reputed to lye in the latitude of thirty
  seaven or between thirty seaven degrees and five minutes or thereabouts and
  hath bin soe generally taken and approved on by all persons for some considerable
  space of years ... if the Lord Baltemore please to take his comencement from
  the Capes ... and from thence measure by line two degrees fifty five minutes
  will just reach to the fortieth degree.' (AOM 5:384) (<a href="figures.html">see
  figure 5</a>)</p>
<p> In reply to this, Lord Baltimore proposed his idea, a much easier and more
  practical solution. 'My Pattent gives me the fortieth degree of northern latitude
  for my northern bounds and there is noe way soe certaine to find that as by
  an observacon to be taken by a sextant of six or seaven foote radies...'(AOM
  5:384) Penn wants the 40 degree line to be measured from Cape Charles, on the
  southern tip of the Delmarva Peninsula. It is believed that Penn stood so steadfast
  behind his proposed method of locating the northern boundary because he knew
  the inaccurate estimation of 60 miles to one degree would leave the line about
  29 miles south of the true 40 degree line. (in fact, there are about 69.5 miles
  in a degree of latitude) This would be enough of a descrepancy to place the
  head of the Chesapeake Bay in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p> A survey of this kind could not have been accomplished, because measuring
  due north from Cape Charles would run into the bay. (<a href="figures.html">see
  figure 5</a>) Lord Baltimore stood behind the plan he gave to Markham earlier,
  that they should simply sail up the Delaware River and find the 40 degree line
  with a sextant (a surveying device). </p>
<p>Both parties bickered back and forth, and outlined their positions, but no
  agreements were made. Also, when Lord Baltimore asked about Penn's recently
  aquired lands on the Delaware, Penn stated that he would address that matter
  then the northern boundary was settled. The next meeting was held at New Castle
  in April of 1683. Both proprietors stood behind their previous methods for locating
  the boundary, and the results were similar to the previous meeting. At this
  point Penn agreed to follow Lord Baltimore's plan, only if Lord Baltimore would
  sell him land adjacent to the head of the Chesapeake Bay. Lord Balitmore declined,
  and the situation was still unsettled. </p>
